- Candidate can type exit to immediately stop the conversation.  

## Example Interaction
- **TalentScout**: Hello! I am TalentScout, your hiring assistant. Can I start by asking your name and tech stack?  
- **Candidate**: I am Rahul, Python & SQL developer with 3 years of experience.  
- **TalentScout**: Great, Rahul! Since you have 3 years of experience, I'll ask intermediate-level Python questions.  
- **Question**: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?  
- **Candidate**: A list is mutable, a tuple is immutable.  
- **TalentScout**: Correct!  

## Assignment Alignment
